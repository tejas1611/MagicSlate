## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* To run on Android Studio, ensure two dependencies are added.
```java
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.4.0'
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-scalars:2.4.0'
```
* To run the backend Python scripts, following modules are required
1. OpenCV `pip install opencv-contrib-python`
2. Scikit-Image `pip install scikit-image`
3. Flask `pip install Flask`
4. UUID (Universally unique identifier) `pip install uuid`
5. Numpy `pip install numpy`

## Deployment

Not ready for deployment yet. Still a lot of work...
